quick idea for text games:

if fighting takes place, an "enemy" boolean can be added to a game square so that an item/weapon can't be "used" a second time in that game square.

a "changed" or "altered" boolean to prevent items being used after they already have and to prevent the text from appearing if user trys to use an item again in same game square
